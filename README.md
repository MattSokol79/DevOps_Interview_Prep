### What is Agile?
Agile is an iterative methodology that allows for rapid delivery
of increments throughout development of a product. The 4 key values:
1. **Individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools** - Promotes team work
2. **Working software over comprehensive documentation** - Focus is put on
building rather than writing documents. Aided with epics and user stories
3. **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation** - Customer feedback
helps in delivering a successful product
4. **Responding to change over following a plan** - Adaptability helps
in delivering a product
- **Example** - Weekly sprints covering small topics which all contribute to 
the DevOps course

### What is Scrum? Ceremonies
Scrum is a **framework** used to implement an agile methodology, it helps teams work 
together and encourages them to learn through experiences, self-organise while 
working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continously improve.
Scrum is very similar to Agile, it is based on continous learning and adjustment to 
fluctuating factors.

**Ceremonies:**

Ceremonies are designed to heavily reflect the values of Agile promoting collaboration
within the team and to have a clearly defined process to follow. 
1. **Organise the backlog** - An ordered and dynamic list of everything that is to be completed
during the project overseen by the product owner. 
2. **Sprint planning** - Meeting to understand what is to be done in this sprint by everyone. 
Led by scrum master and a sprint goal is created. User stories created and team knows what
is expected - usually two days of work.
3. **Sprint** - Typically 2 weeks, actual period when the scrum team works together to finish an
increment.
4. **Daily Scrum or Stand-up** - Daily **super-short** meeting 15 mins usually. Goal is for 
everyone on the team to be on the same page aligned with the sprint goal. A time to voice
any concerns or change things up. 
5. **Sprint Review** - At the end of each sprint team gets together to inspect what has been done. 
Everything is showcased to stakeholders if they attend. Aim is to gain feedback and determine
whether everything was done to satisfactory standard or to change things up. Backlog can change
6. **Sprint Retrospective** - Team comes together at end of sprint 90 mins, and allows them to evaluate
what worked and what didnt work in the sprint.  The idea is for the team to focus on what went well, and 
what needs to be improved for the next time and less about what went wrong. 

### Scrum roles, artifacts and events
**Roles:**
1. **Product Owner** - Represent customers and stakeholders. They are focused on understanding
business and customer needs then prioritising work to be done by the team. They build and 
manage the product backlog, give the team guidance and decide when to ship the product
2. **Scrum master** - Leaders of the Scrum, they coach teams, product owners and look for ways
to fine-tune their practice of scrum. They make sure the scrum is understood by EVERYONE
and they give people responsibility of sprint planning/stand-up/retrospective/review.
3. **Development Team** - Usually 5-7 members or small enough to share 2 pizzas! Self-organising
team responsible for delivering the products and fulfill each sprint etc while working together. 
They decide how long each iteration will take.

**Artifacts**

Enable the team and stakeholders to understand the development process and identify
what will be done, and what was completed.:
1. **Product Backlog** - Master list of work that needs completing. The list is constantly
evolving due changing customer requirements or stakeholder needs. The team "TO DO" list.
2. **Sprint Backlog** - Everything that needs doing in a current sprint. Can evolve during the
sprint however the fundamental sprint goal cannot be compromised. List of items, user stories etc.
3. **Increment or Sprint Goal** - Where the sum of everything that was done during the 
sprint is showcased. It must meet Definition of Done "DoD" which is a predefined criteria 
for a successfully finished product. It is the decision of the team on whether to release
their product or work on it further after this point. 

**Example of SCRUM/Agile**
- Throughout the DevOps course we implemented Agile and Scrum values in order to finish
projects. Everyday we would have morning stand-ups where we discussed what topics/projects
will need to be completed by the end of the day and what is expected of us. Trello was
a key tool which showcased the sprint backlog for the course and outlined what needs doing
for every task we were set. 

### Difference between Agile & Scrum
Agile is a methodology whilst Scrum is a framework. Scrum is used to implement agile. There
are other potential frameworks that can implement agile such as Kanban. Agile if more of an
idea of how to work, Scrum is a method of implementing that idea in a set of rules to follow.

### 3 Amigos
Refers to the primary perspectives to examine an increment of work before, during and after development:
- Business Analyst - What problem are we trying to solve? Make sure everyone understands user stories.
- Developer - How might we build a solution to solve that problem? Responsible for requirements of project.
- Tester - What about this, what could possibly happen? Will try and find issues to enhance testing process.

### Persona
Fictional characters which are created by a team to represent different user types that
might use your product/service. Helps the team understand users' needs, experiences, 
behaviours and goals. 

### Starfish retrospective
Ask the team for feedback
- Keep Doing - Something the team is doing well
- Less of - Something that is being done but might need refining because it is not currently
helpful or productive e.g. behaviour, an activity or routine
- More of - Activities that should be done more often
- Stop Doing - Things that dont bring value or are getting in the way
- Start Doing - New Idea. Something you would like to bring to the table to improve the 
process.

### Information radiators
A display whether handwritten or electronic which a team places in a highly visible location
so that all team members and anyone else can see latest info of current projects
e.g. count of automated tests, velocity, reoprts etc. AKA Big Visible Chart
- Example - Trello

### Root cause Analysis
Method of problem solving used for identifying the root causes of faults or problems. 
Basic method to use:
- Define the problem.
- Gather information, data and evidence.
- Identify all issues and events that contributed to the problem.
- Determine root causes.
- Identify recommendations for eliminating or mitigating the reoccurrence of problems or events.
- Implement the identified solutions.
